    "text": "A page from my own sketchbook, May 2025, Lyon, France\nLink to the post on my substack\n\nWhy are we so fascinated by notebook flipthroughs? Like some of you, I’m an absolute fan of artistic notebook flipthrough videos : I’ll watch almost any kind - off the top of my head, Eleanor Doughty’s are favorites, for instance one, or that one. The New Yorker once called this passion a “delightful form of snooping”, while writing about the Sketchbook Project. (This giant project began by giving blank Moleskines to people for a small fee and archiving whatever came back. In the end, there were thousands of notebooks from all sorts of people, that you could go and browse at the Brooklyn Art Library - the archives are now in transit to several museums.) Here, I’m not talking about why having a sketchbook matters. I’m talking about why I love watching a video of the pages turning in a finished sketchbook. For me, it is energizing in the sense that you see individual pieces that form the flow of artistic life (a drawing of a building, or your little nephew’s feet) into a whole, an enclosed project that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. And as in all well-written stories, what makes a sketchbook flipthrough memorable is that there is variety: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Self-editing your own sketchbook too much might even do you a disservice. On that note, my mum used to say that the best part of my watercolor paintings was the blank paper next to the actual painting where I tested my colours. There’s beauty in seeing a sketchbook through to the end; a sense of awe at the artist’s consistency. September is a month of beginnings - usually a month when you start a sketchbook with a whole new academic year ahead of you (whether you’re a student or not), the crisp blank paper full of promises. Now, why not take an old sketchbook, finish it, and flip through it? Because, why the heck not.\nExhibition: I went to David Hockney’s exhibition (Hockney 25) in Paris two weeks ago — I made a video of my favourite paintings — and saw multiple echoes of van Gogh’s work. There was a room in the exhibition dedicated to Hockney’s work on moons (the moon room). Funnily enough, just as van Gogh tried to paint at night (arguing that even if he couldn’t see the colors on his palette, he could see the real scene in front of him), David Hockney resolved the quandary of painting outdoors at night by using the inherent lighting of the iPad.\nLearning about how we make statues: A little while ago, I went drawing at the Musée Bourdelle in Paris with a friend. It has a garden full of sculptures made by Bourdelle, where you can sketch under the trees and walk along the green path that takes you from one gigantic statue to the next. I ended up watching a video on the process of making a bronze statue — I had no idea it was this complex! I couldn’t find the video shown at the museum, but the Rodin Museum has a detailed description online.\nI read the children’s book Les Vermeilles by Camille Jourdy. It is an enchanting tale about a girl who loses herself in the forest and meets all sorts of strange animals and people (for instance, the tiny queen and king on minuscule horses), echoing Spirited Away. The depiction of the forest, full of dots, reminded me of David Hockney’s paintings of Normandy although the color palettes are different: Hockney uses more vibrant greens, while Camille Jourdy works with pastel greens.\nI re-read Austin Kleon’s Keep Going this week. I love this author — he is one of the best “artistic self-help” authors I know, and I mean that in the best possible way. Brace yourself for my favourite quotes: “Leonardo da Vinci made ‘to-learn’ lists. He’d get up in the morning and write down everything he wanted to learn that day.” I’d take that any day over the endless to-do list at the start of the school year. The second one is about creative practice and money: “The minute anybody shows any talent for anything we suggest they turn it into a profession. […] We used to have hobbies; now we have ‘side hustles’.” And now, for something completely different: “I ignore every ‘35 under 35’ list published. […] I only want to read the ‘8 over 80’ list.” Finally, that last bit is essentially the reason I am making this newsletter in the first place: “If art begins where we point our attention, a life is made out of paying attention to what we pay attention to.”\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Link to the post on my substack\n\nI’ve been reading Letters to Theo by Vincent van Gogh.\nIt is the correspondence Vincent wrote throughout his life to his brother.\nThe letters are in turn poetic, funny, witty, delightfully weird, and all in all wonderful. For instance, in this 1883 letter, he starts with: I feel what Pa and Ma instinctively think about me (I don’t say reasonably). There’s a similar reluctance about taking me into the house as there would be about having a large, shaggy dog in the house. He’ll come into the room with wet paws – and then, he’s so shaggy. He’ll get in everyone’s way. And he barks so loudly. In short – it’s a dirty animal. I mean, the man was funny.\nI visited Auvers-sur-Oise and stopped by the Château d’Auvers for the exhibition The Last Journeys of Vincent Van Gogh.\nIt focuses on his last four years. The audio guide is narrated by Wouter van der Veen – who was also invited by Radio France to talk about Vincent and money (he describes himself as a free biographer on the subject). The exhibition starts with Theo’s success in Paris with his gallery, then moves on to Vincent’s life in Paris, and then the usual steps: Arles, Saint-Rémy, Auvers-sur-Oise. The exhibition concludes with a short animated film by Fleur de Papier, telling the story of Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. She was Vincent’s brother Theo’s wife, widowed at 28 with a baby. She devoted her life to making his art known, in a world of men who considered her, at best, irritating and obsessed with a dead, unknown crazy guy. I instantly adored her.\nIn an episode on Radio France, Jan Blanc, art historian, talks about how Vincent did not associate painting with pain, as many people depict him, so much as he saw painting as a healing process. In that sense, the paintings with the cut ear are not about that at all, but rather paintings with the bandaged ear.\nI saw the animated film Loving Vincent, a 2017 British-Polish production that tells the story of an investigation into the death of Vincent van Gogh through the character of Armand Roulin, son of the postman Roulin, one of Vincent’s friends. The film alternates between sequences painted entirely by hand in oil, imitating more than 80 of Van Gogh’s canvases, and black-and-white passages recounting periods or episodes of his life that he did not paint. I watched the making-of video on YouTube: more than 80 oil painters were hired to paint Vincent’s canvases after the scenes were filmed against a green screen. The character of Armand Roulin must deliver Vincent’s last letter to Theo and therefore travels to Paris, where he meets Père Tanguy, and then to Auvers-sur-Oise, where he seeks out Dr. Gachet. In Paris, he wanders through paintings of the Moulin de la Galette, the vineyards of Montmartre, and the Place Clichy. The filmmakers explain that some of the paintings’ color palettes had to be modified to match the season chosen for the film: summer. The palette was therefore borrowed from other of Vincent’s paintings of Paris depicting summer.\nIn the same vein as oil painting, I tested the set of brushes made by Manero Brushes to reproduce this technique on Procreate. He offers a few tutorial videos on YouTube. I focused on several brushes in particular.\nManero’s tutorials are excellent, but quite fast to follow, so I prefer to do the main steps at the same time as him, then try to make my own painting separately without trying to reproduce the whole detailed process, because I find that I learn better by doing my own. I made an illustration with a van Gogh inspiration (photo from the newsletter). Thousands and thousands of tiny brushstrokes.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "In honor of my parents going to Japan, today’s list is made up of Japanese art-related things (except the first one).\nLink to the post on my substack\n\nI’ve been reading a lot about lists lately. Lists can be forms of art. In the preface to Lists of Note, Shaun Usher, who describes himself as a professional nerd, explains why we absolutely adore lists as human beings. He gives three reasons: “life is chaotic”; “everyone is a critic” (ranking things is addictive, I count myself in that category while writing this); and finally “time is precious” (making lists saves us time, so we have more time for hobbies and, of course, to make more lists). The book comprises many lists, some of which are terrifying or hilarious (like the list of temporary golf rules sent to club members while bombs were being dropped on the course in 1940, Richmond, England: “during gunfire or while bombs are falling, players may take cover without penalty for ceasing play”), some are wittily written (list of rules for not flirting, distributed by the Anti-Flirt Club, an organization of women in the 1920s), and some are surprisingly accurate (a wish list of things to be achieved by science made in 1662 - many of which have since come true). I also remembered stumbling upon a self-help psychology book about lists at the library a few years back. Most were the typical kinds of lists meant to help with life (your classic run-of-the-mill to-do lists), but what I loved were the weirder ones: like someone’s favorite lost lists. For instance, one person lost a list made in Mexico, in front of La Casa Azul - where Frida Kahlo lived - containing the names of all the cats that had lived there, as told by the gardener (mysteriously lost on a bus). Art comes from all sorts of places - but for me, those places are often recorded in the Notes app on my phone. I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that “the most interesting thing on someone’s phone is in their notes app,” as said by Hannah Connolly. In that spirit, go and make a weird list today !\nAnimation: last month, I had the opportunity to see Little Amélie, or the Character of Rain in a small cinema in the village in the Alps where I was staying.\nHalfway through the film, I was completely charmed by: the multitude of colorful plants in the garden; Amélie’s discovery of white chocolate; the little radio that the Japanese nanny, Nishio-san, always carries with her to do her gymnastics; the way Amélie bottles all the sounds and impressions of the seaside for her nanny in a glass jar; the intricate construction of the lantern for the river ceremony; the making of spinning tops (goma) that make the child dizzy; and the reading of the Book of Monsters (yōkai).\nThe style kept reminding me of something. It was only at the end that I noticed the name Lucrèce Andreae, credited for the storyboard. She is an incredibly talented artist, known for the short film Pépé le morse (about grief over a grandfather’s death) and the graphic novel Flipette et Vénère.\nThere are echoes in color and form across all three pieces: Amélie’s wide eyes as she looks at the garden resemble the child’s oversized eyes as he stares across the dunes at his grandfather’s “ghost”; the purplish tones of Amélie’s skin underwater mirror Vénère’s skin color in the graphic novel.\nThis year, I discovered Tsukimi, a podcast created by Mathilda Motte. I especially focused on the archived episodes that explore the stories and notable features of the traditional Japanese calendar (Kyûreki), month by month. There are 72 microseasons in a year. As I publish this post, the current microseason is swallows depart. Last week, wagtails sing was in season, and next week, thunder’s voice quiets will follow. In September, the podcast invites us to observe: the leaves turning khaki green, dried sunflowers drooping, and the nostalgic feeling of summer’s end (nagori).\nRadio interview: Ryoko Sekiguchi is a talented author and translator. In an old interview, she explains that writing can sometimes be a lonely endeavor. I remember she mentions three poetic ways to ease that weight:1) She would go out and eat at countertops in restaurants - not just any table, not on a patio, but at the old-fashioned, cafeteria-style counter where you’re never really eating alone. 2) While writing, she would also cook something very slowly, like a stew - the sounds and smells of cooking creating a presence. 3) She would buy lots of flowers to fill her apartment - thanks to all the money she had saved during the pandemic.\nBook: Tsubaki Stationery Store, Ito Ogawa. In this book, the main character returns to her hometown to work as a public scribe, in the shop her grandmother left her. The story is seemingly simple, but it’s filled with beautifully detailed artistic processes. The character always takes the time to create - with her own hands - the most beautiful solution to each request. It’s funny because, in the book, she mentions feeling guilty when looking at her fountain pens, which she never cleans properly - unlike her grandmother, who always did. And now, this book gives me that exact same feeling whenever I think about my own fountain pen, which I also never clean properly (I know I should).\n\nThank you for reading this totally free, human-made newsletter that focuses on art-related things I found interesting - and that hopefully you do too.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
